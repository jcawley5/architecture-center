title: The Phases of the SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology
description: SAP's integration strategy focuses on creating a seamless, intelligent suite of business applications by integrating end-to-end processes across SAP, partner, and third-party solutions, aiming to accelerate innovation and deliver significant business value. A key component of this strategy is the SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology, which provides a comprehensive framework for defining, documenting, and executing enterprise integration strategies, covering both technical and organizational aspects, and can be adapted to various integration technologies and organizational needs.

The SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology offers a well-defined adoption path along four phases that guide you through the process from defining to executing an enterprise integration strategy.

Each phase is comprised of a set of steps describing the context, procedure and related information. The graphic shows the current scope of phases and steps of this methodology:

***

## 1. Assess Your Integration Strategy

As a starting point an enterprise architect uses the SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology to identify the future building blocks for an organization’s integration architecture. For this purpose, the methodology offers a technology-agnostic scoping approach, which supports hybrid IT environmentsthat are comprised of SAP and third-party technologies and applications, too. As a result, you will have defined the functional scope of an organization’s future hybrid integration platform.

***

## 2. Design Your Hybrid Integration Platform

In this phase, an enterprise architect maps the results of the integration strategy assessment to the matching integration technologies based on customer context factors. For each integration technology the enterprise architect specifies integration policies that describe when to use which technology. Whenever integration developers plan to implement an integration scenario, they can perform an interface assessment to determine the best fitting integration technology with the help of the concepts of this methodology.

***

## 3. Define Integration Best Practices

Next, an integration architect defines architecture blueprints for the integration use case patterns that are relevant for their organization. These blueprints outline the scope of technologies, how they’re interconnected and further information, which is relevant for integration scenarios. Furthermore, the integration architect can define integration dos and don’ts, which integration developers can use as guardrails to implement integration scenarios in a consistent fashion. The integration architect also prepares development guidelines for applicable integration technologies, for instance by enriching vendor-specific best practices with customer-specific aspects \(such as naming conventions for integration artifacts\).

## 4. Enable a Practice of Empowerment

The last phase focuses on non-technical but organizational aspects of enterprise integration. These include concepts for institutionalizing an Integration Center of Excellence, which allows decentralized project teams to develop integration scenarios in an agile way based on the defined integration strategy. Furthermore, you will get to know concepts for introducing integration governance and integration quality assurance across an organization.

By following the SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology, you’ll create several deliverables to define, document, and execute an integration strategy for an enterprise.

## Getting Started with Applying the Methodology

SAP provides two options for applying the SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology in an organization.

| |Templates-based|Tool-based|
|---|---------------|----------|
|Asset|Collection of templates \(Microsoft PowerPoint, Excel, Word files\)|Integration Assessment capability within SAP Integration Suite|
|Objective|Define and document an enterprise integration strategy|Define, document, and govern the execution of an enterprise integration strategy|
|Prerequisite|None|SAP Integration Suite subscription, which includes Integration Assessment|
|Access|You can choose one of the following options:

1.  Download single templates from the respective sections of this documentation.
2.  Download the "SAP Integration Solution Advisory Template Collection", which contains all templates.

|You can choose one of the following options:

1.  Perform the Initial Setup of Integration Assessment and follow the steps of the Integration Assessment Process.
2.  Start the SAP Discovery Center Mission "Get started with SAP Integration Suite – Integration Assessment", which includes a sample scenario for performing your first integration assessment.

|

It is also possible to combine both options: You start with the templates-based approach followed by the tool-based one:

1.  Starting with the templates-based approach you can make yourself familiar with the concepts of the methodology and you can collaborate with others on defining and reviewing your enterprise integration strategy.
2.  You enter your previously defined integration strategy in the Integration Assessment capability within SAP Integration Suite and maintain any updates in this tool.
