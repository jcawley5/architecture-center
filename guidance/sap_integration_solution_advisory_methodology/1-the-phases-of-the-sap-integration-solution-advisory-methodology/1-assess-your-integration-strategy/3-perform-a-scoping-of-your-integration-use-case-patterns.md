Get the third level of integration architecture assessment by selecting integration use case patterns that are relevant for your organization.

***

## Context

As part of the last step to assess your integration strategy, you identify the integration use-case patterns, which are relevant for your organization. Each integration style can be refined by use case patterns, which describe frequently used integration use-cases in enterprise landscapes. Based on the same principles, cross use-case patterns can complement one or more of the five core integration styles such as “API-managed integration” or “event-based integration”. Like integration domains and integration styles, integration use-case patterns are also defined in a technology agnostic way.

The SAP Integration Solution Advisory Methodology includes a catalog of integration use-case patterns that you can use as a starting point for your organization. If needed, you can flexibly adjust the library of integration use-case patterns, for instance by adding customer-specific integration use-case patterns or remove the ones that aren’t relevant in your organization.

  
  
**Catalog of Integration Use Case Patterns**

An integration architect who has a strong knowledge about integration requirements across the enterprise performs the scoping of integration use-case patterns.

In the following section, you can find the catalog of integration use-cases patterns grouped per integration style. Each pattern is complemented with examples in an SAP context. These are either examples, which are predefined by SAP or, which are typically custom-defined by customers or partners.

## Procedure

1.  Templates-based approach  
  
**Integration Use Case Pattern Scoping Template**

    ![](images/loiob494f2ed582d4d1ea6bc3480e0810cec_LowRes.png "Integration Use Case Pattern Scoping Template")

    Download the "Integration Use Case Pattern Scoping Template" for performing a scoping of integration use case patterns.

    To perform the scoping of integration use case patterns, you first check the predelivered catalog regarding the relevance to your organization. You can indicate the various relevance options using different font types:

    1.  -   Relevant as of today: Apply bold type \(example: A2A Integration\)
-   Relevant in future: Apply normal type \(example: Data Virtualization\)
-   Not relevant: Strike through \(example: Event-Based Integration\)
-   Under evaluation: Apply italic type \(example: Thing-to Process Integration\)

    2.  If you have identified integration use case patterns in your organization, which, aren’t part of predelivered catalog \(for example: industry specific or custom integration use case patterns\), you can add them to the related integration style \(or cross use case pattern\). It’s recommended to apply a different border type \(for example, dotted line\) which will allow you to differentiate the custom ones from the predelivered ones.

2.  Tool-based approach

    Perform this step using the Integration Assessment capability within SAP Integration Suite.
