Start by assessing the current integration strategy of your organization.

***

## Description

You start the assessment with the review of the existing integration architecture followed by a scoping of its future building blocks. To conduct such an assessment, the methodology offers a well-defined top-down approach for scoping of requirements toward the to-be integration architecture. This is done with the help of integration domains, integration styles, and integration use case patterns.

The motivation for performing such an integration strategy assessment can be various: One of the most common drivers is the transition toward SAP S/4HANA, which also allows you to streamline your integration approach and to benefit from new integration options. Depending on the business and technology strategy of your organization, other drivers to revisit the integration strategy can apply such as:

-   Need to cover new integration use case patterns, for instance when adopting new technologies
-   Implementation of new cloud-based solutions, which offer new integration options
-   Standardization and governance of the technology landscape
-   Consolidation of existing integration technologies, which can require to phase out selected integration technologies
-   Mergers and acquisitions to remove any possible redundancies or overlaps in integration technologies

***

## Goal

The goal is to have the building blocks of your organization’s integration architecture defined which meet both the current and future integration requirements of an organization.

***

## Deliverables

During this phase you’ll create three documents:

-   List of relevant integration domains
-   List of relevant integration styles
-   List of relevant integration use case patterns

. If the SAP delivered templates don’t meet all your requirements, you can adapt and enrich them according to your needs.

***

It’s recommended to involve the following personas in this phase:

-   Enterprise architect
-   Integration architect
-   Integration developer
